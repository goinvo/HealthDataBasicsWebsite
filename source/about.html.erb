            <p class="line-height-prose">
                A knowledge gap exists between what people understand about the medical R&D system and what the system is asking them to do. According to research, most people understand the health care system collects an immense amount of their information. Many may ask, “where’s my data going?

                <br> <br>
                To bridge the gap, <i>FasterCures</i> has developed a set of tools to help people understand what makes up their health data, how the information is collected and shared, and how it is used. This important work pushes forward individual and community understanding of how data can support patients, caregivers, and providers making decisions about health.

                <br> <br>
                Originally, this project was funded through a $250,000 Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) Eugene Washington PCORI Engagement Award (#4202-MI). The award allowed <i>FasterCures</i> and GoInvo to create tools that are brief, easily accessible to individuals, and aligned with their educational needs. Surveys, in-depth interviews, and user-testing with participants informed all created resources.

                <br> <br>
                Now, <i>FasterCures</i> is making continued efforts to partner with patients and organizations alike to utilize these tools and help make health data more accessible for every individual.

                <i>FasterCures</i>, a Washington, D.C.-based Center of the Milken Institute, is driven by a singular goal – to save lives by speeding up and improving the medical research system. For too long, patients’ unmet medical needs have been an afterthought, rather than a starting point, for developing medical products that address their priorities and deliver value to the health-care system.</p>

                GoInvo’s design practice is dedicated to user centered innovation in healthcare. Their team has a significant track record in software for patients, clinicians, researchers, and analysts over the past decade, and high rates of customer satisfaction and enthusiasm. Working with organizations focused on healthcare, they come with the right experience to help FasterCures execute this project.</p>
