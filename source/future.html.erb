            <p class="line-height--prose">
               Our greatest potential to treat and cure patients may lie in our ability to engage patients in their health data and to ensure that the data can be used appropriately and effectively for their benefit. We believe this can only happen if there is trust among patients and the organizations that will be poised to use this data to improve health and advance science.

            <h2 class="text-center padding-top--medium"> What are we doing? </h2>
            <p> 
                To inspire trust in the system, <i>FasterCures </i> is asking its community of like-minded organizations to develop a unified commitment to a future where health data is available, secure, and ethically â€“ and transparently - used to the benefit of all.
